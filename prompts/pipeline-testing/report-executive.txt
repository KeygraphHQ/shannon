# Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary
- Target: {{WEB_URL}}
- Assessment Date: {current date}
- Scope: Authentication, XSS, SQL and Command Injection, SSRF, Authorization testing

## Summary by Vulnerability Type

**Authentication Vulnerabilities:**
Three authentication vulnerabilities were successfully exploited. Critical findings include session management bypass allowing unauthorized access, weak password policy enabling brute force attacks, and missing multi-factor authentication on administrative functions.

**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**
One authorization vulnerability was successfully exploited: privilege escalation through role manipulation in user profile settings.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
One XSS vulnerability was successfully exploited: CSS injection in the chart styling component enabling CSRF token extraction and keylogging capabilities.

**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**
One injection vulnerability was successfully exploited: SQL injection in user search functionality allowing database enumeration and data extraction.

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**
No SSRF vulnerabilities were successfully exploited due to network access restrictions.

## Network Reconnaissance

**Open Ports and Services:**
- Port 80/tcp: HTTP service, redirects to HTTPS
- Port 443/tcp: HTTPS service, main application access point

**Security Headers:**
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) configured with max-age=31536000
- X-Frame-Options set to DENY preventing clickjacking attacks
- Content Security Policy implemented with nonces

# Authentication Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### AUTH-VULN-01: Session Management Bypass

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** Session token predictability in authentication system
- **Impact:** Complete authentication bypass allowing unauthorized access
- **Severity:** Critical

**Exploitation Evidence:**
Successfully bypassed authentication by predicting session tokens through temporal analysis. Gained administrative access to user management functions.

### AUTH-VULN-02: Weak Password Policy Exploitation

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** Insufficient password complexity requirements
- **Impact:** Account takeover through brute force attacks
- **Severity:** High

**Exploitation Evidence:**
Successfully performed brute force attacks against multiple user accounts due to weak password policy allowing simple passwords.

# Authorization Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### AUTHZ-VULN-01: Privilege Escalation via Role Manipulation

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization checks in user profile settings
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation from standard user to administrator
- **Severity:** High

**Exploitation Evidence:**
Successfully escalated privileges by manipulating user role parameters in profile update requests, gaining administrative access.

# XSS Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### XSS-VULN-01: CSS Injection with Token Extraction

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** CSS injection in chart styling component using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- **Impact:** CSRF token extraction and keylogging capabilities
- **Severity:** Medium

**Exploitation Evidence:**
Successfully injected CSS code that extracted CSRF tokens and demonstrated keylogging capabilities. CSP blocked data exfiltration but exploitation was proven.

# Injection Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### INJ-VULN-01: SQL Injection in User Search

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** SQL injection in user search functionality
- **Impact:** Database enumeration and sensitive data extraction
- **Severity:** High

**Exploitation Evidence:**
Successfully exploited SQL injection to enumerate database structure and extract sensitive user information including password hashes.

# SSRF Exploitation Evidence

## Potential Vulnerabilities (Validation Blocked)

### SSRF-VULN-01: Internal Service Access via URL Parameter

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerability:** SSRF in URL processing service
- **Current Blocker:** Network access restriction
- **Potential Impact:** Internal service enumeration and data access
- **Confidence:** HIGH

**Evidence of Vulnerability:**
Code analysis shows SSRF vulnerability in URL processing service but exploitation blocked by network restrictions.
